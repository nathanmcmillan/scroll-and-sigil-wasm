# scroll and sigil webgl

Legacy browser golang + webgl project

## Outdated TODO
- Production should cache files on server
- Allow config files for creating things/scenery/items/missiles (instead of hard coded)
- Server should and cull network traffic per person based on visibility
  the same logic should be applicable for view culling for client rendering
  cast rays from edges of cube/blocks and determine if "solid" block prevents view
- Camera will zoom to avoid clipping terrain
- Client side movement prediction/reckoning
- Chatbox for people to talk
- Motion blur shader
- Anti aliasing shader
- Ambient occlusion shader
- Depth of field shader
